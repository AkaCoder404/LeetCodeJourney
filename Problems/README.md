Leetcode problems are categorized in two ways: difficulty and tags

Difficulty: How difficult the problem is, being easy, medium, or hard.
Tag: What type of problem it is, may include many tags.

The problem notes will be seperated by which tag I think best represents the problem, although each problem may have mutliple tags.
